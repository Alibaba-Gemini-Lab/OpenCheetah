* `resnet50_model_scale12.inp` A trained resnet50 model with scaling factor = 12 
  * `resnet50_input_scale12_pred249.inp` The preprocessing of the [input image](./resnet50_input_image_n02109961_36.jpeg) which is predicted to label 249.
* `sqnet_model_scale12.inp` A trained SqueezeNet model with scaling factor = 12 
  * `sqnet_input_scale12_pred248.inp` The preprocessing of the [input image](./sqnet_input_image_n02109961_36.jpeg) which is predicted to label 248.
